Consider a nonsingular n Ã— n matrix A and an n-dimensional column vector b.
Using Gaussian elimination, we wish to solve for the n-dimensional column vector x
where Ax = b

Write a computer program for the naive Gaussian elimination.

Use the program to solve

4x + 1y + 1z + 1w = 7 
1x + 4y + 1z + 1w = 7
1x + 1y + 4z + 1w = 7
1x + 1y + 1z + 4w = 7


1. This code is written in python3, in ".ipnyb" format, run it in jupyter notebook or google collab 
2. All code is added in same notebook
3. Mat A and Mat b are used for testing the naive gaussian code 
4. Later the given linear equations were solved as input of given matrice ie Mat g and Mat bg.
