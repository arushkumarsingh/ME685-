Consider a nonsingular n × n matrix A and an n-dimensional column vector b.
Using Gaussian elimination, we wish to solve for the n-dimensional column vector x
where Ax = b

Write a computer program for the naive Gaussian elimination.


Use the program to solve

1. This code is written in python3, in ".ipnyb" format, run it in jupyter notebook or google collab 
2. All code is added in same notebook
3. Mat A and Mat b are used for testing the naive gaussian code 
4. Later the given linear equations were solved as input of given matrice ie Mat g and Mat bg.
