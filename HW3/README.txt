Write a a computer program to solve an algebraic equation f (x) = 0 using Newton Raphson Method.
Using the above computer program, compute the value of x where x = tan x and 0 < x < 2π. For convergence, set precesion = 10−6

Run the code in MATLAB with the file path, where the file is extracted

1. The solution is wriiten in MATLAB (R2019b version)

2. The function for the Newton Raphson is written in "NewRap.m" file, the function is called in "main.m" file 

3. The solution for tan x is found in "main.m" file calling "NewRap.m" function.
